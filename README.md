**Asteroids** is a classic arcade-style shooter game recreated using Python and Pygame. Players control a spaceship that can rotate, thrust forward, and fire shots to destroy drifting asteroids in space. The game features responsive controls, real-time collision detection, and modular code architecture to support future gameplay expansion.

This project was developed as a solo challenge to reinforce core Python concepts and explore game development using Pygame. It helped strengthen my understanding of game loops, object-oriented programming, and 2D physics systems.

## Gameplay

- Rotate the ship with the **left/right arrow keys**
- Thrust forward with the **up arrow key**
- Fire shots with the **spacebar**
- Avoid and destroy the asteroids to survive!
- (Win condition not implemented yet)
